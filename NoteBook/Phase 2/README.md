# Data Summarization and Preprocessing

The goal of this phase was to explore the dataset, visualize its features, and apply necessary preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for modeling.

## 1. Dataset Summarization

In this step, we performed an in-depth analysis of the raw dataset to understand its characteristics. The following tasks were accomplished:

- **Raw Dataset Overview**:
  A sample of the raw dataset was provided to give context to the analysis.

- **Variable Distribution**:
  We used various plotting techniques including scatter plots, histograms, and bar plots to visualize the distribution of each feature in the dataset.

- **Statistical Summaries**:
  Central tendency (mean, median) and variability (variance) were computed for each feature to understand the general distribution of data.

- **Class Label Distribution**:
  We created visualizations to detect any class imbalance by analyzing the distribution of the target class labels.

- **Missing Values**:
  Missing values were identified and documented, providing insight into areas that required data cleaning.

## 2. Preprocessing Techniques

Several preprocessing techniques were applied to the data to improve its quality and prepare it for modeling:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  We handled missing values and removed any noise present in the dataset to ensure clean and reliable data.

- **Data Transformation**:
  Necessary transformations were applied to the variables to ensure they were suitable for the modeling process.

- **Feature Selection**:
  We removed irrelevant or redundant features, optimizing the dataset to improve the modelâ€™s performance and reduce complexity.

- **Normalization**:
  Feature normalization was performed to scale the data and ensure consistent ranges across all variables.

## 3. Justification for Preprocessing Techniques

Each preprocessing step was carefully chosen and justified based on the nature of the data and the requirements for subsequent analysis and modeling. The steps taken were necessary to:
- Improve data quality.
- Address potential class imbalance.
- Ensure that all features are on a similar scale for model efficiency.

## 4. Results and Documentation

The following results are included in this repository:
- Visualizations: Plots showcasing the variable distribution, class label distribution, and other exploratory analyses.
- Statistical Summaries: Central tendency measures (mean, median) and variability measures (variance).
- Preprocessing Documentation: A detailed account of the transformations applied to the dataset, including missing value handling, data cleaning, and normalization.

The results and code are available in this GitHub repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
