# Phase 1: Data Selection 

## In this phase, I identified and selected a relevant dataset for analyzing traffic accidents and predicting accident severity. The dataset contains key information about environmental and traffic conditions during accidents, including attributes such as accident severity, weather conditions, and road status. The dataset consists of 840 instances and 14 attributes, which include variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and traffic volume.
--
## The selected dataset serves as the foundation for the project, which aims to leverage data mining techniques to identify patterns and predict accident severity. The objective is to enhance road safety, improve transportation systems, and optimize emergency response strategies.
--
## The dataset provides a clear representation of the problem domain, making it suitable for applying clustering techniques to identify patterns and classification algorithms to predict accident severity.
